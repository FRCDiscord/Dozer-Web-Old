                            I am an alum of Team 2410, Metal Mustang Robotics. In my time on the team, I worked with graphic design, team media, and electrical, became the team's overall captain, and oversaw both build and administrative aspects of the team.

Following graduation, I continued my involvement in FIRST, becoming an event volunteer, and now help with both the AV side of the show as well as slowly climbing the ranks as a rising MC and referee for both FRC and FTC events. Additionally, I am a key volunteer for VEX Worlds as an MC.
