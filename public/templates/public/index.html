                The <strong><i>FIRST</i>速 Robotics Competition Discord Server</strong> is an unofficial <i>FIRST</i>速 community platform designed to
                promote communication and collaboration between <i>FIRST</i>速 teams throughout the world and the <i>FIRST</i>速
                community.

                There needs to be some large, relevant, possibly dynamic content right here. Maybe it's announcements, maybe it's logs,
                maybe it's something else entirely, but I need ideas. After all, what does the main page of a website for
                a <i>Discord server</i> even need? If you notice I'm aiming for something similar
                to how <a href="https://thebluealliance.com">TBA's main page</a> is layed out.
